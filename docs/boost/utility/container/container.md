# GO Boost Utility Library - Container

```c++
<go_boost/utility.hpp>
```

## Description

The **GO Boost Utility Library** is not really a single library at all. It is a collection
of components too small to be called libraries in their own right.

Functions in the **go_boost\::utility\::container** namespace are intended to simplify use of
containers.
