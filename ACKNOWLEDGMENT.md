Dear reader,

I develop the the [GO C++ Libraries](https://goranorsander.github.io/go_libs/)
on my spare time. As most software developers, I presume,
I search the internet for solutions to the problems I
encounter. The following articles have provided insights
and ideas that contribute to my design and implementation.

* [A Policy-Based Property Implementation in C++](https://cheind.wordpress.com/2011/12/13/a-policy-based-property-implementation-in-c/)

* [C++ string_cast<> template function](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/1205/c-string-cast-template-function)

* [Defining a custom iterator in C++](https://lorenzotoso.wordpress.com/2016/01/13/defining-a-custom-iterator-in-c/)

* [lsignal: C++ signal/slot system](https://github.com/cpp11nullptr/lsignal)

* [MVVM articles on Rachel Lim's Blog](https://rachel53461.wordpress.com/category/mvvm/)

* [NanoLog - Low Latency C++11 Logging Library](https://github.com/Iyengar111/NanoLog)

* [std::string formatting like sprintf](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2342162/stdstring-formatting-like-sprintf)

I found [kbroman/simple_site](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site)
to be a good tutorial on how-to setup GitHub Pages.

Kind regards  
GÃ¶ran Orsander
