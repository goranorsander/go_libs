# GO Boost Utility Library - Iterator

```c++
<go_boost/utility.hpp>
```

## Description

The **GO Boost Utility Library** is not really a single library at all. It is a collection
of components too small to be called libraries in their own right.

Functions in the **go_boost\::utility\::iterator** namespace are intended to help working
with iterators.

## Reference

### Function reference

* [erase](./function_template_erase.html)
* [try_move_backward](./function_template_try_move_backward.html)
