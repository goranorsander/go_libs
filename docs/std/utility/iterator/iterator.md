# GO Std Utility Library

```c++
<go/utility.hpp>
```

## Description

The **GO Std Utility Library** is not really a single library at all. It is a collection
of components too small to be called libraries in their own right.

Functions in the **go\::utility\::iterator** namespace are intended to help working
with iterators.

## Reference

### Function reference

* [go\::utility\::iterator\::**erase**](./function_template_erase.html)
* [go\::utility\::iterator\::**try_move_backward**](./function_template_try_move_backward.html)
