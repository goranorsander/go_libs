# GO Std Utility Library - Iterator

```c++
<go/utility.hpp>
```

## Description

The **GO Std Utility Library** is not really a single library at all. It is a collection
of components too small to be called libraries in their own right.

Functions in the **go\::utility\::iterator** namespace are intended to help working
with iterators.
