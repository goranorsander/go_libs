# INTRODUCTION

When **C++11** was released I wanted to learn the new features introduced. I soon realized that it was
unlikely to happen at work. Migrating the company C++ source code, projects, solutions, etc. was
simply to big a task. I wanted a reasonably challenging idea for a hobby project and decided to try
implement an **MFC**-based application using the **MVVM** (Model–View–ViewModel) architecture pattern.
This was the start of the **GO C++ Libraries**.

The **GO C++ Libraries** have two main implementations. The first uses **C++11/14/17** and the
**C++ Standard Library**. The second uses **C++98/03** and the **Boost Libraries**. I find it
interesting to do both implementations. Doing the first std-based implementation gives me the
opportunety to learn about new **C++11/14/17** features. The second boost-based implementation
broaden my knowledge of the **Boost Libraries**.
